## Net Neutrality


Net Neutrality is a concept in which an Internet Service Provider must provide access to the Internet without any interference.[^Novak23Net]

The term was first coined by Tim Wu in 2003.  Net neutrality was defined then as the principle of broadband operators not interfering with networks.[^maillé22Net] Tim Wu would send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and the official definition was summarized as follows:

1. No content access can be denied to users. 
2. Users are free to use the applications of their choice. 
3. They can also use any type of terminal, provided that it does not harm the network. 
4. They can competitively select the access and content providers of their choice.

There are many contentions in the concept of net neutrality and if the call for a democratized internet was truly realized. According to Phillipe Perebinossoff, Net Neutrality is an ideal that has never been realized.[^perebinossoff08Net] Depending on many variables such as equipment, traffic levels and connections, the service provided can vary greatly.
